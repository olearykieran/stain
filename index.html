                      always felt a strong intuition to advocate against injustices
                      affecting people, animals, and the environment, so this project
                      specifically means a lot to her, especially at times like these,

                      American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan. In her free time,
                      she loves to travel and paint.
